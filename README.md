## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Cam!

I work best when I have to adapt, figure things out, adjust, and improve as I go. Thatâ€™s why I build projects to solve my own problems, creating tools that are practical and effective.

Iâ€™m all about making things that work because theyâ€™re built on the right insights. Every project is an experiment, a challenge, and a way to keep learning.
